# pokemon-go-ical

A service that converts the Leek Duck events feed (JSON) into an ICal (`.ics`)
file that can be integrated with systems like Google Calendar.

This is currently hosted using AWS via SAM, and is currently only intended for
my own personal use.

As I learn more from this prototype, I may invest more time into making it more
generic and useful to others.
